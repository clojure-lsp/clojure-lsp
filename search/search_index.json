It is highly recommended that you increase the Init timeout from 10000 (10s) to e.g. 300000 (5 min). The first scan can easily take over a minute on a bigger project. See Preferences / Languages & Frameworks / Language Server Protocol / Timeouts. If the plugin's icon in the status bar (a circle) turns red, it means starting clojure-lsp failed. Click on it and select Show timeouts - any limits that were exceeded will be in red.

Note: Most of these are available via code actions and clients or users may choose to use the code action menu to execute them instead of mapping. All functions in clojure-lsp have a two-letter mnemonic shortcut. E.g. tf for thread-first-all . We strongly suggest that client authors and users use these shortcuts keys when choosing to map these commands to key chords or menus; this allows for users to maintain muscle memory and familiarity as they switch between clients and editors. Thank you to clj-refactor for this system and other tools that adhere to it. LSP clients will allow you to bind these commands to shortcuts or menu items using LSP's workspace/executeCommand and passing a map with \"command\" and \"arguments\" keys.

You can configure how clojure-lsp should find the classpath with the project-specs setting, but keep in mind that usually the default is enough, it will also consider the :source-aliases setting if any to find the classpath using those aliases. Supported project types at the moment are: leiningen : If a project.clj is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run lein classpath with :source-aliases specified if any. deps : If a deps.edn is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run clojure -Spath with :source-aliases specified if any. boot : If a build.boot is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run boot show --fake-classpath . shadow-cljs : If a shadow-cljs.edn is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run npx shadow-cljs classpath . babashka : If a bb.edn is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run bb print-deps --format classpath . Note that it's possible to have more than one project type at the same time e.g. deps + babashka, clojure-lsp will merge the classpath and everything should work fine. Make sure to have these programs available on the PATH environment variable used by your editor, otherwise clojure-lsp will warn about a classpath scan fail, causing a lot of features to not work properly. Alternatively, you can configure the project-specs specific for your project, for example: .lsp/config.edn { :project-specs [{ :project-path \"deps.edn\" :env { \"PATH\" \"/some/custom/path\" } ;; optional if you want to override the PATH used in the classpath-cmd :classpath-cmd [ \"clojure\" \"-A:my-custom-alias\" \"-Spath\" ]}]} Note that clojure-lsp will make this scan to save the cache when: The project has no cache ( .lsp/.cache ) The project deps file ( project.clj for example) changed. The clj-kondo config has changed. Diagnostics (linter) # Default: Check :linters in all-available-settings.edn . clj-kondo # clojure-lsp uses clj-kondo under the hood to lint the code and retrieve the analysis to make most of features work, you don't have to install clj-kondo to make it work. clojure-lsp will use a specific clj-kondo version that can be retrieved via clojure-lsp --version , but make sure you have it properly configured in your .clj-kondo/config.edn file. It has the possible key/values: :clj-kondo :level with available values: :off , :on with default value of :on :report-duplicates which will show all linters of the same symbol instead of showing only the first spot. Available values: true , false with default value of true ns-exclude-regex which will exclude the diagnostics/findings for namespaces that match this regex. Example: .lsp/config.edn { :linters { :clj-kondo { :level :on :report-duplicates true :ns-exclude-regex \"some-ns.*\" }}} Note for vim users If you are a (neo)vim user and have [ale](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) installed as a plugin, you **should not** have this configured as a linter `let g:ale_linters = {'clojure': ['clj-kondo']}` in your vimrc. Having this linter enabled via `ale` will only conflict with the built-in clj-kondo bundled with clojure-lsp. Also, clojure-lsp by default pass copy-configs flag as true to clj-kondo to copy configurations exported from libs on classpath, to disable this behavior, set copy-kondo-configs? setting to false. For more information about all clj-kondo available configurations, check the clj-kondo configuration section Custom clj-kondo linters # Clojure-lsp register custom linters in clj-kondo, for specifically those linters, configurations should be done on clj-kondo config files, e.g. ( <project>/.clj-kondo/config.edn ). Note that configuring these custom linters via clj-kondo's ns metadata config is not supported. Below are the custom linters used: clojure-lsp/unused-public-var # A custom linter that reports public functions/vars not used over the project. It has the possible key/values: :level with available values: :info , :warning , :error or :off with default value of :info . :exclude a whole namespace with #{my-ns} or a specific var #{my-ns/foo} . :exclude-regex same as above but with support for regex, like #{\"my-ns/f.*\"} . :exclude-when-defined-by excludes this linter when your var is defined by a macro for example, like #{my-ns/deftest} . :exclude-when-defined-by-regex same as above but with support for regex, like #{\"my-ns/.*\"} . :exclude-when-contains-meta excludes this linter when your var has any of these metas, like #{:my-meta} . Example: .clj-kondo/config.edn { :linters { :clojure-lsp/unused-public-var { :level :warning :exclude # { my-ns/foo my-ns/bar other-ns my-func } :exclude-regex # { \"my-integration-tests.*\" } :exclude-when-defined-by # { my-ns/defflow } :exclude-when-defined-by-regex # { \"my.custom/macro-.*\" } :exclude-when-contains-meta # { :my-cool-meta }}}} clojure-lsp/different-aliases # Sometimes, it's desirable to use the same alias across namespaces to enhance readability and reduce cognitive load. It has the possible keys/values: :level with available values: :info , :warning , :error or :off with default value of :off . :exclude-aliases ignores the symbols provided in a set, example #{sut} clj-depend # clojure-lsp uses clj-depend when any clj-depend config is found either on clojure-lsp config or as a .clj-depend/config.edn file. The clj-depend config should be within the :config key. { :config { :layers { :controller { :defined-by \".*\\\\.controller\\\\..*\" :accesses-layers # { :logic }} :logic { :defined-by \".*\\\\.logic\\\\..*\" :accesses-layers # { :model }}}}} When you need to inform some other parameter for clj-depend that is not a config, you can inform it this way: { :config { ,,, } :snapshot? true } Disable linter # It's not recommended to disable a linter as it provides helpful smart checks/suggestions for your code, even so it's possible via the following config: .lsp/config.edn { :linters { :clj-kondo { :level :off } :clj-depend { :level :off }}} For information on how to troubleshoot the linter, check the troubleshooting section Source paths discovery # Some features require know the available source paths of your project, where your code lives, clojure-lsp has some settings for that. By default, clojure-lsp will infer source-paths from the classpath, excluding files that are jar and not under project-root, this usually works for most cases, if not, check next items. You can specify a source-aliases setting, making clojure-lsp use those alias when conmputing the classpath, e.g. #{:src :test :my-alias} If that is not enough, for example you have source-paths that are not included on any project profile (not recommended), you can manually specify via the :source-paths settings. e.g [\"src\" \"test\" \"my/other/folder\"] . Clean # Default: Check :clean in all-available-settings.edn . automatically-after-ns-refactor # Whether to call clean-ns on the namespace after applying any refactor to it like adding missing require/imports/refers. ns-inner-blocks-indentation # How to indent ns children forms like require,import. next-line # Keep first child on the next line of :require / :import and next children following the same indentation.

Ex: ( :import [ java.io File Foo ]) Also, check :sort :import-classes below for more customizations. sort # to disable a specific sort you can set it to nil, example: { :clean { :sort { :import-classes nil }}} ns # Whether to enable sort of ns children like require, import forms following Clojure Style Guide . require # Whether to enable sort of :require form. true to sort according to the Clojure Style Guide, :lexicographically to do a lexicographic sort that places unwrapped namespaces last. import # Whether to enable sort of :import form. import-classes # Whether to enable sort of package classes inside :import form. :classes-per-line : the max classes allowed to keep in a single line, if more than this value, clojure-lsp will move all classes to :next-line or :same-line following :ns-import-classes-indentation , Possivel values: any positive number or -1 to keep all classes in the same line. refer # Whether to enable sort of :refer form. :max-line-length : the max refers to keep at same line before breaking the line. Default 80 . Snippets # Besides the 19 built-in snippets, it's possible to configure custom additional snippets via :additional-snippets setting: :name the name to use while completing to reach that snippet. :detail Custom text to show along with the completion name. :snippet The body of the snippet, besides any text it can contains: $1 , $2 , ... as the tabstops representing each place where user may change the content. $0 as the last tabstop. $current-form to replace the current form in the snippet. Example: { :additional-snippets [{ :name \"wrap-let-sexpr\" :detail \"Wrap current sexpr in let\" :snippet \"(let [$1] $0$current-form)\" }]} when completion is called on the code below with the cursor as | wrap| ( + 1 2 ) It should return a completion item that after applied should result in: ( let [ | ] ( + 1 2 )) Java support # At the moment, clojure-lsp only supports find definition of java classes and completion of fields/methods when it detects a Java class (mostly from static classes usages), other features are not supported yet. When a find-definition of a java class is triggered, clojure-lsp checks the following: If the java source( .java ) is available on classpath, clojure-lsp just return that file location. If the java source is not available, only the .class , clojure-lsp decompiles it. If :java :decompile-jar-as-project? is enabled, clojure-lsp decompiles the whole jar at the global cache folder ( ~/.cache/clojure-lsp/java ) If :java :decompile-jar-as-project? is disabled, clojure-lsp decompiles the class file at the local cache folder ( .lsp/.cache/java ) If the java class is from JDK (e.g. java.util.UUID ), clojure-lsp tries a few things to be able to sucessfully find the definition, following this waterfall decision: Most JRE installations contains the java source code in a src.zip , clojure-lsp tries to find it via :java :home-path setting if provided, JAVA_HOME env var or java command on PATH , if found clojure-lsp extracts to its global cache dir ($XDG_CACHE or ~/.cache/clojure-lsp ) to be used in other projects. If src.zip is not found or user specified a custom :java :jdk-source-uri , clojure-lsp tries to download the source from that uri, only if :java :download-jdk-source? is enabled, disabled by default, extracting to the global cache dir later. Stub generation # It's possible to configure clojure-lsp to generate and analyze stubs for specific namespaces available on your project classpath, this is useful for closed source dependencies like datomic.api , with that clojure-lsp will be able to make most features work with those dependencies. The available settings inside :stubs are: :generation for auto stubs generation: :namespaces the namespaces to generate and analyze stubs, empty by default disabling stub generation. :output-dir the output where to generate the stubs, by default .lsp/.cache/stubs :java-command the path to java command to spawn the stub process, default use java from $PATH . :extra-dirs , dirs to analyze to consider as part of manual generated stubs. Empty by default. Example: { :stubs { :generation { :namespaces # { \"datomic.api\" }}}} This should generate stubs for datomic.api namespace only on .lsp/.cache/stubs and clojure-lsp should analyze that during startup to provide completion, hover and other features. Or to use manual generated stubs: { :stubs { :extra-dirs [ \".my-stubs\" ]}} clojure-lsp will generate no stubs with that, but analyze that folder and consider it as manual generated stubs.

As last resource if your project has a enormous number of some specific elements, it's possible to disable some analysis which should help decrease memory usage and even increase performance via the :analysis setting, but keep in mind that some features related to those analysis may not work, for example, {:analysis {:keywords false}} will remove support for find-references of keywords, or {:analysis {:java {:class-definitions false :member-definitions false}}} will completly disable java features like auto completion of java elements.","title":"High memory usage"},{"location":"troubleshooting/#macos","text":"In some version of MacOS, Apple restrict the binary to run, to fix that run: xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/clojure-lsp","title":"MacOS"},{"location":"api/api/","text":"API (JVM) # The namespace clojure-lsp.api should be used as the entrypoint for all available features of the CLI and some specific for library only usage, feel free to open a issue for missing features.
