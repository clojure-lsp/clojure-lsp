# Settings

`clojure-lsp` settings are picked up only on server start and can be configured via 4 ways:

- [Project configuration](#project)
- [Global configuration](#global)
- [LSP InitializationOptions](#initialization-options)
- [Classpath config paths](#classpath-config-paths)

### Project

`clojure-lsp` will look for project specific settings in a file called `.lsp/config.edn`. It will search from your project root folder up the directory structure so you can have multiple projects share the same settings.

Example:
```clojure
{:cljfmt {:indents {#re ".*" ns [[:inner 0] [:inner 1]]}}
 :auto-add-ns-to-new-files? false}
```

---
### Global

For global settings which should work for all the projects using `clojure-lsp`, you just need to add the same configs to `~/.lsp/config.edn` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.lsp/config.edn`.

For an example of a global `config.edn`, check [here](https://github.com/ericdallo/dotfiles/blob/master/.lsp/config.edn).

---
### InitializationOptions

This is specific for an client, where it sends on startup, check [LSP spec for more information](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#initialize). This is useful if you are changing a default for a client/editor that will affect all users of that editor.

This is an [example how Emacs `lsp-mode`](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/blob/master/clients/lsp-clojure.el#L205) pass custom information.

If you are using a client which defines InitializationOptions as a json object, you can use json types instead:

- keyword -> string or colon-prefixed string (`"incremental"` or `":incremental"`)
- map -> object (`{"unused-public-ns": {"level": "info"}}`)
- set -> array (`["src" "test"]`)
- vector -> array (`["src" "test"]`)

### Classpath config paths

When starting the server, clojure-lsp will search for a specific path `clojure-lsp.exports/<group-id>/<artifact-id>/config.edn` for extra configurations in the classpath, only if you set the setting `:classpath-config-paths` containing that `group/artifact`. Example:

Lib `my-org/my-lib` could have a clojure-lsp config edn that makes sense for the usages of that lib, making available on the classpath:

`my-lib/resources/clojure-lsp.exports/my-org/my-lib/config.edn`
```clojure
{:cljfmt {:indents {foo [[:block 0]]}}}
```

and then if your project use/has the `my-org/my-lib` inside your classpath, you could add the setting

`your-project/.lsp/config.edn`
```clojure
{:classpath-config-paths ["my-org/my-lib"]}
```

And then clojure-lsp will merge the configuration from the lib with the other configurations from your project.

This is useful if you have some rule to apply to clojure-lsp for multiple projects, mostly using via API for linting for example, and want to move the common configuration to some place instead of adding to each project that needs that.

## All settings

You can find all settings and its default [here](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp/blob/master/docs/all-available-settings.edn) and below the docs for each one:

### Classpath scan

clojure-lsp needs to analyze the whole project and its dependencies to understand your code for most features, during the startup clojure-lsp will try to find the classpath of your project to pass to clj-kondo later. 

You can configure how clojure-lsp should find the classpath with the `project-specs` setting, check the default [here](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp/blob/master/src/clojure_lsp/crawler.clj#L53-L60).

Supported project types at the moment are:

- `leiningen`: If a `project.clj` is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run `lein classpath`.
- `deps`: If a `deps.edn` is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run `clojure -Spath`.
- `boot`: If a `build.boot` is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run `boot show --fake-classpath`.
- `shadow-cljs`: If a `shadow-cljs.edn` is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run `npx shadow-cljs classpath`.
- `babashka`: If a `bb.edn` is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run `bb print-deps --format classpath`.

Note that it's possible to have more and one project type at the same time e.g. deps + babashka, clojure-lsp will merge the classpath and everything should works fine.

Make sure to have these programs available on the `PATH` environment variable used by your editor, otherwise clojure-lsp will warn about a classpath scan fail, causing a lot of features to not work properly. 

Alternatively, you can configure the `project-specs` specific for your project, for example:

`.lsp/config.edn`
```clojure
{:project-specs [{:project-path "deps.edn"
                  :classpath-cmd ["clojure" "-A:dev" "-Spath"]}]}
```

Note that clojure-lsp will make this scan to save the cache when:

- The project has no cache (`.lsp/.cache`)
- The project deps file (`project.clj` for example) changed. 
- The clj-kondo config has changed. 

### Diagnostics (linter)

Default: Check `:linters` in [all-available-settings.edn](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp/blob/master/docs/all-available-settings.edn).

#### clj-kondo

`clojure-lsp` uses [clj-kondo](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo) under the hood to lint the code and retrieve the analysis to
make most of features work, you don't have to install clj-kondo to
make it work.

`clojure-lsp` will use a specific clj-kondo version that can be retrieved via `clojure-lsp --version`, but make sure you have it
properly configured in your `.clj-kondo/config.edn` file.

It has the possible key/values:

- `:level` with available values: `:off`, `:on` with default value of `:on`
- `:report-duplicates` which will show all linters of the same symbol instead of showing only the first spot. Available values: `true`, `false` with default value of `true`
- `ns-exclude-regex` which will exclude the diagnostics/findings for namespaces that match this regex.

Example:

`.lsp/config.edn`
```clojure
{:linters {:clj-kondo {:level :on
                       :report-duplicates true
                       :ns-exclude-regex "some-ns.*"}}}
```

<details>
<summary>Note for vim users</summary>

If you are a (neo)vim user and have [ale](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) installed as a plugin, you
**should not** have this configured as a linter `let g:ale_linters = {'clojure': ['clj-kondo']}` in your vimrc. Having this
linter enabled via `ale` will only conflict with the built-in clj-kondo bundled with clojure-lsp.

</details>

For more information about all clj-kondo available configurations,
check the [clj-kondo configuration section](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/config.md)

##### Custom clj-kondo hooks

Clojure-lsp register custom linters in clj-kondo, for specifically those linters, configurations should be done on clj-kondo config files, e.g. (`<project>/.clj-kondo/config.edn`), below are the custom linters used:

###### clojure-lsp/unused-public-var

A custom linter that reports public functions/vars not used over the project.

It has the possible key/values:

- `:level` with available values: `:info`, `:warning`, `:error` or `:off` with default value of `:info`.
- `:exclude` a whole namespace with `#{my-ns}` or a specific var `#{my-ns/foo}`.
- `:exclude-when-defined-by` excludes this linter when your var is defined by a macro for example, like `#{my-ns/deftest}`.

Example:

`.clj-kondo/config.edn`
```clojure
{:linters {:clojure-lsp/unused-public-var {:level :warning
                                           :exclude #{my-ns/foo
                                                      my-ns/bar
                                                      other-ns
                                                      my-func}
                                           :exclude-when-defined-by #{my-ns/defflow}}}}
```

#### Disable linter

It's not recommended to disable the linter as it provides helpful smart checks/suggestions for your code, even so it's possible via the following config:

`.lsp/config.edn`
```clojure
{:linters {:clj-kondo {:level :off}}}
```

For information on how to troubleshoot the linter, check the [troubleshooting section](https://clojure-lsp.io/troubleshooting/)

### Source paths discovery

Some features require know the available source paths of your project, where your code lives, clojure-lsp has some settings for that.

- If your project is a `lein` project, clojure-lsp will scan the `project.clj` file for `:source-paths`, `:test-paths` and the paths from the specified `:source-aliases` setting (default `#{:dev :test}`), unless you specified `:source-paths` manually.
- If your project is a `deps.edn`, clojure-lsp will scan the `deps.edn` file for `:paths`, `:extra-paths` and the paths from the specified `:source-aliases` setting (default `#{:dev :test}`), unless you specified `:source-paths` manually.
- If your project is not a `deps.edn` or `lein` project, a `boot` project for example, clojure-lsp will use only the `:source-paths` setting (default `#{"src" "test"}`) which should point to the folders containing your clojure code.

### Clean

Default: Check `:clean` in [all-available-settings.edn](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp/blob/master/docs/all-available-settings.edn).

#### ns-inner-blocks-indentation 

Where to place first require/import following [Clojure Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide#line-breaks-in-ns), `:same-line`, `:next-line` or `:keep`.

#### sort

##### ns

Whether to enable sort of `ns` children like require,import forms following [Clojure Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide#comprehensive-ns-declaration).

##### require

Whether to enable sort of `:require` form.

##### import

Whether to enable sort of `:import` form.

##### refer

Whether to enable sort of `:refer` form.

- `:max-line-length`: the max refers to keep at same line before breaking the line. Default `80`.

### Snippets

Besides the **19** built-in snippets, it's possible to configure custom additional snippets via `:additional-snippets` setting:

- `:name` the name to use while completing to reach that snippet, preferably with a `$` sufix to indicate a snippet.
- `:detail` Custom text to show along with the completion name.
- `:snippet` The body of the snippet, besides any text it can contains:
    - `$1`, `$2`, ... as the tabstops representing each place where user may change the content.
    - `$0` as the last tabstop.
    - `$current-form` to replace the current form in the snippet.

Example:

```clojure
{:additional-snippets [{:name "wrap-let-sexpr$"
                        :detail "Wrap current sexpr in let"
                        :snippet "(let [$1] $0$current-form)"}]}
```

when completion is called on the code below with the cursor as `|`
```clojure
wrap|(+ 1 2)
```

It should return a completion item that after applied should result in:

```clojure
(let [|] (+ 1 2))
```
