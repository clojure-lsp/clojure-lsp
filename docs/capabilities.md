## Extra capabilities

Besides LSP official capabilities, `clojure-lsp` has some extra features:

### Refactorings

It should be possible to introduce most of the refactorings [here](https://github.com/clojure-emacs/clj-refactor.el/tree/master/examples)

#### More details

Calling `executeCommand` with the following commands and additional args will notify the client with `applyEdit`.
All commands expect the first three args to be `[document-uri, line, column]` (eg `["file:///home/snoe/file.clj", 13, 11]`)

See Vim client section for an example.

Emacs provides all those refactorings via [lsp-mode](https://emacs-lsp.github.io/lsp-mode/)  with the `lsp-clojure-` prefix.

Other clients might provide a higher level interface to `workspace/executeCommand` you need to pass the path, line and column numbers.

### Custom commands

`clojure-lsp` has some custom commands:


| command             | args                           | notes                                                          |
| ------------------- | ----                           | -----                                                          |
| server-info         |                                | Use to retrieve server and configuration information           |
| cursor-info         | `[document-uri, line, column]` | Use to retrieve debugging information for the symbol at cursor |
