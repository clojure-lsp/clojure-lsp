GraalVM # Every release the native binaries (Windows, Linux and MacOS) are compiled with GraalVM and uploaded. To build a native image with GraalVM: Install the GraalVM 21.0.0 for Java 11 and set the GRAALVM_HOME to the installation dir Install native-image with $GRAALVM_HOME/bin/gu install native-image Run from clojure-lsp project root ./graalvm/native-unix-compile.sh or ./graalvm/native-windows-compile.bat . The build may take some minutes and the result will be a ./clojure-lsp native binary. Development # For clojure-lsp development, there are 3 possible ways of finding a bug or implementing a new feature: Create a test for your bug/feature, then implement the code following the test. clojure-lsp starts a NREPL server if built with lein with-profile :debug bin , with that it's possible to change the code of a running instance and see the changes on your client in real time. To get the NREPL port, you can check the /tmp/clojure-lsp.*.out log, it will print the NREPL port on server startup or you can get it via server-info custom LSP command. Build clojure-lsp with your changes and test it manually in your client, this is the slowest option, but it makes sense for final tests. For debugging purposes, there is two custom commands server-info and cursor-info . Support the project # clojure-lsp has more than 8.000 lines of code, to keep all of this working, we need to help the community on a lot of issues and implement new features. As a LSP server, this project is the base for Clojure clients like Emacs(lsp-mode), VSCode(Calva) and vim.

If the project root has a deps.edn file, it'll run clojure -Spath to get the classpath. If the project root has a build.boot file, it'll run boot show --fake-classpath to get the classpath. If the project root has a shadow-cljs.edn file, it'll run npx shadow-cljs classpath to get the classpath. If your project doesn't follow the above rules or you need a custom command to get the classpath you need to configure the project-specs clojure-lsp setting, for more details check the settings section .
