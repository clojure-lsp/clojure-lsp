# Settings

`clojure-lsp` settings are picked up only on server start (but they can be [changed](#changing-settings) on runtime) and can be configured in 4 ways:

- [Project configuration](#project)
- [Global configuration](#global)
- [LSP InitializationOptions](#initialization-options)
- [Classpath config paths](#classpath-config-paths)

### Project

`clojure-lsp` will look for project specific settings in a file called `.lsp/config.edn`. It will search from your project root folder up the directory structure so you can have multiple projects share the same settings.

Example:
```clojure
{:cljfmt {:indents {#re ".*" ns [[:inner 0] [:inner 1]]}}
 :auto-add-ns-to-new-files? false}
```

---
### Global

For global settings which should work for all the projects using `clojure-lsp`, you just need to add the same configs to `~/.config/clojure-lsp/config.edn` or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/clojure-lsp/config.edn`.

Note: `~/.lsp/config.edn` is considered too but deprecated.

For an example of a global `config.edn`, check [here](https://github.com/ericdallo/dotfiles/blob/master/.config/clojure-lsp/config.edn).

---
### InitializationOptions

This is specific for a client, which it sends to `clojure-lsp` on startup, check [LSP spec for more information](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-current/#initialize). This is useful if you are changing a default for a client/editor that will affect all users of that editor.

This is an [example how Emacs `lsp-mode`](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode/blob/master/clients/lsp-clojure.el#L205) pass custom information.

Another example, for neovim users, using [coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) and [coc-clojure](https://github.com/NoahTheDuke/coc-clojure) can be found [here](https://github.com/dharrigan/vimconfig/blob/master/coc-settings.json)

If you are using a client which defines InitializationOptions as a json object, you can use json types instead:

- keyword -> string or colon-prefixed string (`"incremental"` or `":incremental"`)
- map -> object (`{"unused-public-ns": {"level": "info"}}`)
- set -> array (`["src" "test"]`)
- vector -> array (`["src" "test"]`)

### Classpath config paths

When starting the server, clojure-lsp will search for a specific path `clojure-lsp.exports/<group-id>/<artifact-id>/config.edn` for extra configurations in the classpath, only if you set the setting `:classpath-config-paths` containing that `group/artifact`. Example:

Lib `my-org/my-lib` could have a clojure-lsp config edn that makes sense for the usages of that lib, making available on the classpath:

`my-lib/resources/clojure-lsp.exports/my-org/my-lib/config.edn`
```clojure
{:cljfmt {:indents {foo [[:block 0]]}}}
```

and then if your project use/has the `my-org/my-lib` inside your classpath, you could add the setting

`your-project/.lsp/config.edn`
```clojure
{:classpath-config-paths ["my-org/my-lib"]}
```

And then clojure-lsp will merge the configuration from the lib with the other configurations from your project.

This is useful if you have some rule to apply to clojure-lsp for multiple projects, mostly using via API for linting for example, and want to move the common configuration to some place instead of adding to each project that needs that.

| `:dependency-scheme`                           | Defines the format that the client and server should use for URLs of dependencies in jars. The two valid values are `"jar"` and `"zipfile"`. Different editors may handle these URLs differently. For example, in nvim when a `"zipfile"` URI is opened, the file will be editable, but `"jar"` URIs will not be. (This can be powerful, but if you edit a jar in your .m2 directory, you may break other projects.) `"jar"` will make urls compatible with java's JarURLConnection. Clients that can't extract the jar natively can make an LSP extension request of `clojure/dependencyContents` with the jar uri and the server will return the jar entry's contents, an approach [used by some Java clients](https://github.com/redhat-developer/vscode-java/blob/a24945453092e1c39267eac9367c759a6c7b0497/src/extension.ts#L290-L298) | `"zipfile"`                                                                                   |

### Classpath scan

clojure-lsp needs to analyze the whole project and its dependencies to understand your code for most features, during the startup clojure-lsp will try to find the classpath of your project to pass to clj-kondo later.

You can configure how clojure-lsp should find the classpath with the `project-specs` setting, but keep in mind that usually the [default](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp/blob/master/lib/src/clojure_lsp/classpath.clj#L184) is enough, it will also consider the `:source-aliases` setting if any to find the classpath using those aliases.

Supported project types at the moment are:

- `leiningen`: If a `project.clj` is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run `lein classpath` with `:source-aliases` specified if any.
- `deps`: If a `deps.edn` is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run `clojure -Spath` with `:source-aliases` specified if any.
- `boot`: If a `build.boot` is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run `boot show --fake-classpath`.
- `shadow-cljs`: If a `shadow-cljs.edn` is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run `npx shadow-cljs classpath`.
- `babashka`: If a `bb.edn` is found at the project root, clojure-lsp will run `bb print-deps --format classpath`.

Note that it's possible to have more than one project type at the same time e.g. deps + babashka, clojure-lsp will merge the classpath and everything should work fine.

Make sure to have these programs available on the `PATH` environment variable used by your editor, otherwise clojure-lsp will warn about a classpath scan fail, causing a lot of features to not work properly.

Alternatively, you can configure the `project-specs` specific for your project, for example:

`.lsp/config.edn`
```clojure
{:project-specs [{:project-path "deps.edn"
                  :env {"PATH" "/some/custom/path"} ;; optional if you want to override the PATH used in the classpath-cmd
                  :classpath-cmd ["clojure" "-A:my-custom-alias" "-Spath"]}]}
```

Note that clojure-lsp will make this scan to save the cache when:

- The project has no cache (`.lsp/.cache`)
- The project deps file (`project.clj` for example) changed.
- The clj-kondo config has changed.

### Diagnostics (linter)

Default: Check `:linters` in [all-available-settings.edn](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp/blob/master/docs/all-available-settings.edn).

#### clj-kondo

`clojure-lsp` uses [clj-kondo](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo) under the hood to lint the code and retrieve the analysis to
make most of features work, you don't have to install clj-kondo to
make it work.

`clojure-lsp` will use a specific clj-kondo version that can be retrieved via `clojure-lsp --version`, but make sure you have it
properly configured in your `.clj-kondo/config.edn` file.

It has the possible key/values:

- `:clj-kondo`
  - `:level` with available values: `:off`, `:on` with default value of `:on`
  - `:report-duplicates` which will show all linters of the same symbol instead of showing only the first spot. Available values: `true`, `false` with default value of `true`
  - `ns-exclude-regex` which will exclude the diagnostics/findings for namespaces that match this regex.

Example:

`.lsp/config.edn`
```clojure
{:linters {:clj-kondo {:level :on
                       :report-duplicates true
                       :ns-exclude-regex "some-ns.*"}}}
```

<details>
<summary>Note for vim users</summary>

If you are a (neo)vim user and have [ale](https://github.com/dense-analysis/ale) installed as a plugin, you
**should not** have this configured as a linter `let g:ale_linters = {'clojure': ['clj-kondo']}` in your vimrc. Having this
linter enabled via `ale` will only conflict with the built-in clj-kondo bundled with clojure-lsp.

</details>

Also, clojure-lsp by default pass `copy-configs` flag as `true` to clj-kondo to copy configurations exported from libs on classpath, to disable this behavior, set `copy-kondo-configs?` setting to false.

For more information about all clj-kondo available configurations,
check the [clj-kondo configuration section](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/config.md)

##### Custom clj-kondo linters

Clojure-lsp register custom linters in clj-kondo, for specifically those linters, configurations should be done on clj-kondo config files, e.g. (`<project>/.clj-kondo/config.edn`). Note that configuring these custom linters via clj-kondo's [ns metadata config](https://github.com/clj-kondo/clj-kondo/blob/master/doc/config.md#metadata-config) is *not* supported. Below are the custom linters used:

###### clojure-lsp/unused-public-var

A custom linter that reports public functions/vars not used over the project.

It has the possible key/values:

- `:level` with available values: `:info`, `:warning`, `:error` or `:off` with default value of `:info`.
- `:exclude` a whole namespace with `#{my-ns}` or a specific var `#{my-ns/foo}`.
- `:exclude-regex` same as above but with support for regex, like `#{"my-ns/f.*"}`.
- `:exclude-when-defined-by` excludes this linter when your var is defined by a macro for example, like `#{my-ns/deftest}`.
- `:exclude-when-defined-by-regex` same as above but with support for regex, like `#{"my-ns/.*"}`.
- `:exclude-when-contains-meta` excludes this linter when your var has any of these metas, like `#{:my-meta}`.

Example:

`.clj-kondo/config.edn`
```clojure
{:linters {:clojure-lsp/unused-public-var {:level :warning
                                           :exclude #{my-ns/foo
                                                      my-ns/bar
                                                      other-ns
                                                      my-func}
                                           :exclude-regex #{"my-integration-tests.*"}
                                           :exclude-when-defined-by #{my-ns/defflow}
                                           :exclude-when-defined-by-regex #{"my.custom/macro-.*"}
                                           :exclude-when-contains-meta #{:my-cool-meta}}}}
```

###### clojure-lsp/different-aliases

Sometimes, it's desirable to use the same alias across namespaces to enhance readability and reduce cognitive load.

It has the possible keys/values:

- `:level` with available values: `:info`, `:warning`, `:error` or `:off` with default value of `:off`.
- `:exclude-aliases` ignores the symbols provided in a set, example `#{sut}`

#### clj-depend

clojure-lsp uses [clj-depend](https://github.com/clj-depend/clj-depend) when any clj-depend config is found either on clojure-lsp config or as a `.clj-depend/config.edn` file.

The clj-depend config should be within the `:config` key.

```clojure
{:config {:layers {:controller {:defined-by      ".*\\.controller\\..*"
                                :accesses-layers #{:logic}}
                   :logic      {:defined-by      ".*\\.logic\\..*"
                                :accesses-layers #{:model}}}}}
```

When you need to inform some other parameter for clj-depend that is not a config, you can inform it this way:

```clojure
{:config    {,,,}
 :snapshot? true}
```

#### Disable linter

It's not recommended to disable a linter as it provides helpful smart checks/suggestions for your code, even so it's possible via the following config:

`.lsp/config.edn`
```clojure
{:linters {:clj-kondo {:level :off}
           :clj-depend {:level :off}}}
```

For information on how to troubleshoot the linter, check the [troubleshooting section](troubleshooting.md)

### Source paths discovery

Some features require know the available source paths of your project, where your code lives, clojure-lsp has some settings for that.

- By default, clojure-lsp will infer source-paths from the classpath, excluding files that are jar and not under project-root, this usually works for most cases, if not, check next items. 

- You can specify a `source-aliases` setting, making clojure-lsp use those alias when conmputing the classpath, e.g. `#{:src :test :my-alias}`

- If that is not enough, for example you have source-paths that are not included on any project profile (not recommended), you can manually specify via the `:source-paths` settings. e.g `["src" "test" "my/other/folder"]`.

### Clean

Default: Check `:clean` in [all-available-settings.edn](https://github.com/clojure-lsp/clojure-lsp/blob/master/docs/all-available-settings.edn).

#### automatically-after-ns-refactor

Whether to call clean-ns on the namespace after applying any refactor to it like adding missing require/imports/refers.

#### ns-inner-blocks-indentation

How to indent ns children forms like require,import.

##### `next-line`

Keep first child on the next line of `:require`/`:import` and next children following the same indentation. Recommended by [how-to-ns](https://stuartsierra.com/2016/08/27/how-to-ns) guide too.
Check `;; better` on [Clojure Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide#line-break-ns-declaration).

##### `same-line`

Keep first child on the same line of `:require`/`:import` and next children following the same indentation.
Check `;; good` on [Clojure Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide#line-break-ns-declaration).

##### `keep`

Don't change indentation at all, keeping the one user selected first.

#### ns-import-classes-indentation

How to indent classes inside package imports from :import form.
Note: package imports with only one class will keep indentation: Ex: `[java.io File]`

##### `next-line`

Keep the first class inside a package import on the next line and next children following the same indentation. Ex: 

```clojure
(:import 
  [java.io
    File
    Foo])
```

##### `same-line`

Keep the first class inside a package import on the same line and next children following the same indentation. Ex: 

```clojure
(:import 
  [java.io File
           Foo])
```

Also, check `:sort :import-classes` below for more customizations.

#### sort

to disable a specific sort you can set it to nil, example:

```clojure
{:clean {:sort {:import-classes nil}}}
```

##### `ns`

Whether to enable sort of `ns` children like require, import forms following [Clojure Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/clojure-style-guide#comprehensive-ns-declaration).

##### `require`

Whether to enable sort of `:require` form. `true` to sort according to the Clojure Style Guide, `:lexicographically` to do a lexicographic sort that places unwrapped namespaces last.

##### `import`

Whether to enable sort of `:import` form.

##### `import-classes`

Whether to enable sort of package classes inside `:import` form.

- `:classes-per-line`: the max classes allowed to keep in a single line, if more than this value, clojure-lsp will move all classes to `:next-line` or `:same-line` following `:ns-import-classes-indentation`, Possivel values: any positive number or `-1` to keep all classes in the same line.

##### `refer`

Whether to enable sort of `:refer` form.

- `:max-line-length`: the max refers to keep at same line before breaking the line. Default `80`.

### Snippets

Besides the **19** built-in snippets, it's possible to configure custom additional snippets via `:additional-snippets` setting:

- `:name` the name to use while completing to reach that snippet.
- `:detail` Custom text to show along with the completion name.
- `:snippet` The body of the snippet, besides any text it can contains:
    - `$1`, `$2`, ... as the tabstops representing each place where user may change the content.
    - `$0` as the last tabstop.
    - `$current-form` to replace the current form in the snippet.

Example:

```clojure
{:additional-snippets [{:name "wrap-let-sexpr"
                        :detail "Wrap current sexpr in let"
                        :snippet "(let [$1] $0$current-form)"}]}
```

when completion is called on the code below with the cursor as `|`
```clojure
wrap|(+ 1 2)
```

It should return a completion item that after applied should result in:

```clojure
(let [|] (+ 1 2))
```

### Java support

At the moment, clojure-lsp only supports find definition of java classes and completion of fields/methods when it detects a Java class (mostly from static classes usages), other features are not supported yet.

When a find-definition of a java class is triggered, clojure-lsp checks the following:

- If the java source(`.java`) is available on classpath, clojure-lsp just return that file location.
- If the java source is not available, only the `.class`, clojure-lsp decompiles it.
  - If `:java :decompile-jar-as-project?` is enabled, clojure-lsp decompiles the whole jar at the global cache folder (`~/.cache/clojure-lsp/java`)
  - If `:java :decompile-jar-as-project?` is disabled, clojure-lsp decompiles the class file at the local cache folder (`.lsp/.cache/java`)
- If the java class is from JDK (e.g. `java.util.UUID`), clojure-lsp tries a few things to be able to sucessfully find the definition, following this waterfall decision:
    - Most JRE installations contains the java source code in a `src.zip`, clojure-lsp tries to find it via `:java :home-path` setting if provided, `JAVA_HOME` env var or `java` command on `PATH`, if found clojure-lsp extracts to its global cache dir ($XDG_CACHE or `~/.cache/clojure-lsp`) to be used in other projects.
    - If `src.zip` is not found or user specified a custom `:java :jdk-source-uri`, clojure-lsp tries to download the source from that uri, only if `:java :download-jdk-source?` is enabled, disabled by default, extracting to the global cache dir later.

### Stub generation

It's possible to configure clojure-lsp to generate and analyze stubs for specific namespaces available on your project classpath, this is useful for closed source dependencies like `datomic.api`, with that clojure-lsp will be able to make most features work with those dependencies.
The available settings inside `:stubs` are:

- `:generation` for auto stubs generation:
    - `:namespaces` the namespaces to generate and analyze stubs, empty by default disabling stub generation.
    - `:output-dir` the output where to generate the stubs, by default `.lsp/.cache/stubs`
    - `:java-command` the path to java command to spawn the stub process, default use `java` from `$PATH`.
- `:extra-dirs`, dirs to analyze to consider as part of manual generated stubs. Empty by default.

Example:

```clojure
{:stubs {:generation {:namespaces #{"datomic.api"}}}}
```

This should generate stubs for `datomic.api` namespace only on `.lsp/.cache/stubs` and clojure-lsp should analyze that during startup to provide completion, hover and other features.

Or to use manual generated stubs:

```clojure
{:stubs {:extra-dirs [".my-stubs"]}}
```

clojure-lsp will generate no stubs with that, but analyze that folder and consider it as manual generated stubs.


### Changing settings

`clojure-lsp` supports `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` commands to change the server settings while it is running, everything inside the `:settings` map can be changed, but not outside it (the project root for example).
