GraaVM # Every release the native binaries (Windows, Linux and MacOS) are compiled with GraalVM and uploaded. To build a native image with GraalVM, first install the GraalVM 21.0.0 for Java 11, set the GRAALVM_HOME to the installation dir and then run from clojure-lsp project root ./graalvm/native-unix-compile.sh or ./graalvm/native-windows-compile.bat . The build may take some minutes and the result will be a ./clojure-lsp native binary. Development # For clojure-lsp development, there are 3 possible ways of finding a bug or implementing a new feature: - Create a test for your bug/feature, then implement the code following the test. - clojure-lsp starts a NREPL server if built with lein with-profile :debug bin , with that it's possible to change the code of a running instance and see the changes on your client in real time. To get the NREPL port, you can check the /tmp/clojure-lsp.out log, it will print the NREPL port on server startup or you can get it via server-info custom LSP command. - Build clojure-lsp with your changes and test it manually in your client, this is the slowest option, but it makes sense for final tests. - For debugging purposes, there is two custom commands server-info and cursor-info . Contribution # Contributions to clojure-lsp are very welcome! You can open an issue or a PR and we'd love to help. Support the project # clojure-lsp has more than 8.000 lines of code, to keep all of this working, we need to help the community on a lot of issues and implement new features.
