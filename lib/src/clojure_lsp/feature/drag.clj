  "Drag clauses forward or backward.

  {:a 1, :b 2} -> {:b 2, :a 1}

  What constitutes a clause is context dependent. In a map, it will be a
  key/value pair. In a vector it will be a single element, unless the vector
  establishes bindings as in `let`, in which case it will be a pair of elements.
  This code tries to be aware of common functions, data structures and other
  forms, and their conventions for establishing clauses.

  Though this feature was originally called 'move collection entry', it is now
  more generally used to drag any clause forward or backward, even if it isn't
  in an immutable collection."

;;;; Main algorithm for moving a clause

;; 1. Start with a sequence of nodes, the children of the parent expression.
;; 2. Split them up into elements (regular nodes plus affiliated comments) and padding (whitespace) between elements.
;; 3. Separate the rind (the elements and padding that can't be dragged) from the pulp (the ones that can).
;; 4. Based on the breadth of a clause, group the pulp into clauses, leaving interstitial padding between clauses.
;; 5. Notice which clause contains the cursor.
;; 6. Swap that clause with the previous or next clause, depending on the direction of movement.
;; 7. Reposition the cursor so that it appears to maintain its position within the original clause.
