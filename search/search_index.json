Development # For clojure-lsp development, there are 3 possible ways of finding a bug or implementing a new feature: - Create a test for your bug/feature, then implement the code following the test. - clojure-lsp starts a NREPL server, with that it's possible to change the code of a running instance and see the changes on your client in real time. To get the NREPL port, you can check the /tmp/clojure-lsp.out log, it will print the NREPL port on server startup or you can get it via server-info custom LSP command. - Build clojure-lsp with your changes and test it manually in your client, this is the slowest option, but it makes sense final tests.

This is needed, for instance, if your build puts artifacts into resources or target that you want lsp to ignore. use-metadata-for-privacy? if true, will use ^:private metadata for refactorings instead of defn- keep-require-at-start? if true, will keep first require at the first line instead of inserting a new line before it. semantic-tokens? if true or not present, will enable LSP semantic tokens server support for syntax highlighting. show-docs-arity-on-same-line? if true, will keep the arity on the same line of the function on hover, useful for Emacs users. auto-add-ns-to-new-files? if true or not present, will automatically add the ns form in new files. document-formatting? if true or not present, document formatting is provided. document-range-formatting? if true or not present, document range formatting is provided. dependency-scheme by default, dependencies are linked with vim's zipfile://<zipfile>::<innerfile> scheme, however you can use a scheme of jar to get urls compatible with java's JarURLConnection. You can have the client make an lsp extension request of clojure/dependencyContents with the jar uri and the server will return the jar entry's contents. Similar to java clients cljfmt json encoded configuration for https://github.com/weavejester/cljfmt :cljfmt { :indents { \"#.*\" [[ \"block\" , 0 ]] \"ns\" [[ \"inner\" , 0 ] , [ \"inner\" , 1 ]] \"and\" [[ \"inner\" , 0 ]] \"or\" [[ \"inner\" , 0 ]] \"are\" [[ \"inner\" , 0 ]]}} clj-kondo (Experimental) - clojure-lsp uses clj-kondo to lint code, so you can use here any clj-kondo configuration or just have your config file by project at .clj-kondo/config.edn , for more information about clj-kondo available configurations, check here . :clj-kondo { :linters { :missing-docstring { :level :warning }}} ~ linters ~ (Deprecated in favor of clj-kondo ) - some initial support for disabling diagnostics currently only this one that will suppress the unused alias warning and stop the require from being cleaned by clean-ns : :linters { :unused-namespace { :exclude [ clojure.data ]} :unused-namespace-declarations # { \"test/\" \"foo/bar\" }} project-specs - value is a vector containing a map of key/value pairs, for example: \"initializationOptions\" : { \"project-specs\" : [{ \"project-path\" : \"deps.edn\" , \"classpath-cmd\" : [ \"clj\" , \"-Spath\" ]}] } Note: You may also consider configuring project specs via the (optional) .lsp/config.edn file, i.e., { :project-specs [{ :project-path \"deps.edn\" :classpath-cmd [ \"clj\" \"-Spath\" ]}]} Each project-spec will add to the list of dependencies for lsp to crawl: - :project-path is the required filename used by your build tool (project.clj, build.boot, deps.edn, package.json, etc) - :classpath-cmd is the required vector of commands to get your project's classpath string (e.g. [\"clj\", \"-Spath\"] ) - :env optionally add environment variables to the classpath-cmd (e.g. {\"BOOT_FILE\" \"x.boot\"} ) macro-defs # macro-defs value is a map of fully-qualified macro names to a vector of definitions of those macros' forms. Element definitions # An element represents one or more forms within a macro-def vector. They can be defined in two ways: A simple keyword, e.g. :declaration A map that includes the element type and options, e.g. {:element :declaration, :tags [\"unused\" \"local\"], :signature [\"next\"]} Element types # Valid element definitions are: :declaration This marks a symbol or keyword as a definition/declaration of a var in the current namespace. In the simplest case, this element can be specified as the keyword :declaration . You can customize the behavior of the declaration by making it a map. e.g. {:element :declaration, :tags [\"unused\" \"local\"], :signature [\"next\"]} tags are optional. The unused tag supresses the \"unused declaration\" diagnostic, useful for deftest vars. The local tag marks the var as private. signature is optional. If the macro has defn -like bindings, this vector of movements should point to the parameter vector or the first var arg list form. Only next is supported right now. e.g. (my-defn- my-name \"docstring\" [& params] (count params)) => {my.ns/my-defn- [{\"element\": \"declaration\", \"tags\", [\"local\"], \"signature\": [\"next\" \"next\"]}]} :bindings This marks let and for -like bindings. bound-elements will have these bindings in their scope. e.g. (my-with-open [resource ()] ....) => {my.ns/my-with-open [:bindings :bound-elements]} :function-params-and-bodies This will parse function like forms that support optional var-args like fn . e.g. (myfn ([a] ...) ([b] ...)) (myfn [c] ...) => {my.ns/myfn [:function-params-and-bodies]} :params This marks a defn like parameter vector. bound-elements will have these parameters in their scope. e.g. (myfn [c] ...) => {my.ns/myfn [:params :bound-elements]} :param This marks a single defn like parameter. bound-elements will have these parameters in their scope. :elements This will parse the rest of the elements in the macro form with the usual rules. e.g. (myif-let [answer (expr)] answer (log \"no answer\") \"no answer\") => {my.ns/myif-let [:bindings :bound-element :elements]} :element This will parse a single element in the macro form with the usual rules. In the simplest case, :element can be specified as the keyword :element . This will always parse a single element. You can make the :element optional by making it a map that includes a predicate pred which will determine whether the current form is parsed as an :element , or if the :element should be skipped and the current form parsed as the next defined element. For example, you can define an optional docstring element as {:element :element, :pred :string} , or an optional metadata map as {:element :element, :pred :map} . :element can also describe repeated elements. For example, {:element :element, :pred :string, :repeat true} will parse 1 or more strings. :element can also describe multiple elements of different types. This is useful, for example, if you have a macro like adzerk.env/def whose arguments are pairs of declarations and values: (adzerk.env/def FOO :required, BAR nil, BAZ \"string\") => {adzerk.env/def [{:element [:declaration :element], :repeat true}]} :bound-elements This will parse the rest of the elements in the macro form with the usual rules but with any bindings or params in scope. :bound-element This will parse a single element in the macro form with the usual rules but with any bindings or params in scope. See https://github.com/snoe/clojure-lsp/blob/master/test/clojure_lsp/parser_test.clj for examples.

They can be defined in two ways: A simple keyword, e.g. :declaration A map that includes the element type and options, e.g. {:element :declaration, :tags [\"unused\" \"local\"], :signature [\"next\"]}","title":"Element definitions"},{"location":"settings/#element-types","text":"Valid element definitions are: :declaration This marks a symbol or keyword as a definition/declaration of a var in the current namespace. In the simplest case, this element can be specified as the keyword :declaration . You can customize the behavior of the declaration by making it a map. e.g. {:element :declaration, :tags [\"unused\" \"local\"], :signature [\"next\"]} tags are optional. The unused tag supresses the \"unused declaration\" diagnostic, useful for deftest vars. The local tag marks the var as private. signature is optional. If the macro has defn -like bindings, this vector of movements should point to the parameter vector or the first var arg list form. Only next is supported right now. e.g. (my-defn- my-name \"docstring\" [& params] (count params)) => {my.ns/my-defn- [{\"element\": \"declaration\", \"tags\", [\"local\"], \"signature\": [\"next\" \"next\"]}]} :bindings This marks let and for -like bindings. bound-elements will have these bindings in their scope. e.g. (my-with-open [resource ()] ....) => {my.ns/my-with-open [:bindings :bound-elements]} :function-params-and-bodies This will parse function like forms that support optional var-args like fn . e.g. (myfn ([a] ...) ([b] ...)) (myfn [c] ...) => {my.ns/myfn [:function-params-and-bodies]} :params This marks a defn like parameter vector. bound-elements will have these parameters in their scope. e.g. (myfn [c] ...) => {my.ns/myfn [:params :bound-elements]} :param This marks a single defn like parameter. bound-elements will have these parameters in their scope. :elements This will parse the rest of the elements in the macro form with the usual rules. e.g. (myif-let [answer (expr)] answer (log \"no answer\") \"no answer\") => {my.ns/myif-let [:bindings :bound-element :elements]} :element This will parse a single element in the macro form with the usual rules. In the simplest case, :element can be specified as the keyword :element . This will always parse a single element. You can make the :element optional by making it a map that includes a predicate pred which will determine whether the current form is parsed as an :element , or if the :element should be skipped and the current form parsed as the next defined element. For example, you can define an optional docstring element as {:element :element, :pred :string} , or an optional metadata map as {:element :element, :pred :map} . :element can also describe repeated elements. For example, {:element :element, :pred :string, :repeat true} will parse 1 or more strings. :element can also describe multiple elements of different types. This is useful, for example, if you have a macro like adzerk.env/def whose arguments are pairs of declarations and values: (adzerk.env/def FOO :required, BAR nil, BAZ \"string\") => {adzerk.env/def [{:element [:declaration :element], :repeat true}]} :bound-elements This will parse the rest of the elements in the macro form with the usual rules but with any bindings or params in scope. :bound-element This will parse a single element in the macro form with the usual rules but with any bindings or params in scope.
