  "Identify clauses.

  What constitutes a clause is context dependent. In a map, it will be a
  key/value pair. In a vector it will be a single element, unless the vector
  establishes bindings as in `let`, in which case it will be a pair of elements.
  This code tries to be aware of common functions, data structures and other
  forms, and their conventions for establishing clauses.

  It also tries to be aware of how comments are usually written in Clojure code.
  It associates comments 'above' a clause and on the same line 'after' a clause
  with the clause."

;;;; Main algorithm

;;;; Identify clauses

;; 1. Start with a sequence of nodes, the children of the parent expression.
;; 2. Split them up into elements (regular nodes plus affiliated comments) and
;;    padding (whitespace) between elements.
;; 3. Separate the rind (the elements and padding that can't be dragged) from
;;    the pulp (the ones that can).
;; 4. Based on the breadth of a clause, group the pulp into clauses, leaving
;;    interstitial padding between clauses.

(defn ^:private divide-parent
  "Returns the contents of `parent-zloc` split up into elements and padding.

  That is, the return value will be a sequence of sequences of nodes, each
  corresponding to an element or to padding.

  For convenience in the rest of the algorithm, the first item will always be
  padding. If there isn't any whitespace before the first element, this will be
  an empty sequence. There may or may not be a final item of padding."

;; {:rind    [2 0]

;;
;; This says that in this expresion:

;; * `:pulp 4` - four elements in the interior can be dragged: `:foo 1 :bar 2`
;; * `:breadth 2` - pairs of elements should be dragged together as clauses: `:foo 1` and `:bar 2`
;;

  "Returns whether a vector node `vector-zloc` establishes bindings, such as in

  This uses a few heurisitics.

  First, there are several clojure.core functions and macros which establish
  bindings, such as `for`, `let`, `loop` and `binding`. It returns true if
  `zloc` is in one of these expressions (even if the expression is actually
  imported from some namespace besides clojure.core TODO: Is it reasonable to
  assume that any function with one of these names establishes bindings, even if
  it isn't in clojure.core?).

  Otherwise, if the `zloc`'s children are pairs of local variable definitions
  and values (according to the clj-kondo analysis), then this also returns true.
  This allows library- and user-defined code to declare that it establishes
  bindings, via `:lint-as`. Originally this was the only heuristic, since it
  works for `let` and `for`. But it fails for `bindings` and other forms that
  don't establish new variables, but merely reference existing variables,
